An application which easily convert PDF to MP3 with just a few clicks. The software is entirely made of python and number of libraries are used.
The PDF to Audio converter project provides alternative access to academic documents for the blind, weak readers and others. Using an MP3 player the person listens to a synthesized reading of the paper. The audio is divided into tracks and read in multiple voices to accommodate the listeners navigation and comprehension. The developed software performs the PDF to MP3 conversion using the Python programming language and third party components. 

Packages Used:

PyPDF2: It will help to the text from the PDF. A Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit. It is capable of extracting document information, splitting documents page by page, merging documents page by page etc.

gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) : Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate text-to-speech API. We will import the gTTS library from the gtts module which can be used for speech translation. ... The output of the converted text is stored in the form of speech in the tts variable. The tts.

appJar: cross-platform, open source Python library for developing GUIs (graphical user interfaces). It can run on Linux, OS X, and Windows.

Pathlib: rovides various classes representing file system paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems. This module comes under Python's standard utility modules. Path classes in Pathlib module are divided into pure paths and concrete paths.

OS: The OS module plays a important role in the application as it provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc. You first need to import the os module to interact with the underlying operating system.
